1.  Sequence comparison
    1.  Protein sequences: {{% resource_link "b4ba7ef2-da86-42cd-85ee-e2e0553ae895" "amino acids" %}} and their properties
    2.  Why do we need to compare sequences?
        *   Find dissimilarities
        *   Similar sequences = similar properties
        *   Similar sequences = common ancestral genes
    3.  Mutations -> Gapless alignments
    4.  Mutations, insertions and deletions -> Gapped alignment
2.  Sequence alignments
    1.  {{% resource_link "e67d4713-a233-4fa0-a359-1697cbb4895b" "Score = edit distance" %}}
    2.  Examples of scores
    3.  Length of alignment, number of alignments
3.  Algorithms for sequence alignments
    1.  Dynamics programming
    2.  Example
    3.  Global and Local alignments
4.  {{% resource_link "e169c8ea-a442-4086-b43e-27bf05891b43" "BLAST" %}}
    1.  How it works
    2.  Examples
